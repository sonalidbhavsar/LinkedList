When i have added this file using git add , the file goes in staging area. Now after adding I am making changes to file . Git diff will show changes between file in staging area and working directory(on PC).

Output of git diff,
F:\workspaceGit\LinkedList>git diff
diff --git a/file2.txt b/file2.txt

\ No newline at end of file


i have not yet commited the changes after adding this file, so this file is unstaged yet. git diff --staged shows differences between staging area and last commit
